# Checkmate

Checkmate is a Go library designed to enhance the testing experience by providing a set of assertion functions. With Go, there is no built-in assertion library which can make writing tests feel more verbose than it needs to be, so Checkmate aims to fill that gap.

## Installation

To install Checkmate, use the following command:

```bash
$ go get github.com/eugenetriguba/checkmate
```
